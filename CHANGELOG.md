### Added
- Added parallel implementation for multiple activation functions on CSharp backend
- Added `Peek()` function to `IWorker`, it retains object storage in worker's allocator, useful for quick grabbing of output. If you want to preserve content of output tensor between `Execute()` invocations, then use `Fetch()`.

- Fixed Tensor <-> Texture copy for textures/tensors that dimensions are not multiple of 8.
- Fixed ComputeBuffer leak when using Compute and ComputePrecompiled backends.


## 0.1.6
### Added
- Added activation type print in verbose mode
- Added fast and parallel CPU implementation for Swish, Relu, Add, Sub, Div, Min, Max, Tanh, Exp
  
### Changed
- Improved scheduling on CPU for small batches of data

### Removed
- Removed duplicate profiler blocks for ops

### Fixed
- Fixed compatibility with Unity 2019.2.x

## 0.1.5
### Added
- Added Transpose, MatMul and Indentity layer support for models exported from ONNX.
- Added BasicLSTM layer support for models exported from TF. Limited set of LSTM networks should work now.
- Added DepthwiseConv2D layer support. Most of the networks based on the MobileNet should work now.
- Added OneHot layer support for models exported from TF.
- Added optimized path for Conv2D, Dense and Transpose layers with single batch executions. Performance gain up to 100%.
- Added fast optimized path for Sigmoid and Mul layers on CPU.
- Added ``pip`` requirements file for Python dependencies, check ``Tools/requirements.txt```.
- Added proof of concept Docker wrappers for running model conversion inside of Docker container. Check ``Tools/docker-tensorflow-to-barracuda.sh`` and ``Tools/docker-onnx-to-barracuda.sh``. Currently it was tested only on Mac host.
- Added metadata about input shapes to model. Look for ``Model.GetShapeByName()``.
- Added API to query constant Tensors embedded into network, look for ``Model.GetTensorByName()``.
- Added reference implementations for Selu, Abs, Neg, Ceil, Floor, Clip, Rcp, Log layers.
- Added support for Mean, Square, StridedSlice and Border2D layers.
- Added support for Swish activation, now it is automatically detected in models.
- RandomNormal and RandomUniform now supports either embedded shape constant OR previous tensor shape for input.
- Implemented Pix2Pix model (.pict) importer.

### Changed
- Refactored model importers for easier integration with ML Agents.
- Now Barracuda will fallback to CSharpFast if compute shaders are not supported on the current platform.
- Improved compute kernel interop on Android.

### Fixed
- Fixed FMA performance issue on Metal GFX platforms.
- Fixed issue when worker is executed with different batch sizes.
- Fixed input shape determination for Keras sequential model.
- Fixed Tanh NaN issue when large argument is passed.
- Fixed Keras/TF/ONNX FusedBatchNorm/BatchNorm import and now it takes ``epsilon`` into account.


## 0.1.4
### Added
- Implemented fast Conv2DTrans. Useful for GAN type networks.
- Added Unity Companion License as part of distribution.
- Added platform specific BLAS plugin support. Out of the box Barracuda ships with Apple Accelerate framework support for iOS and macOS.
- Added Burst BLAS plugin, greatly improves performance in Unity Editor where native OS BLAS is not available. It's packaged as separate package and requires to have Burst enabled.
  
### Changed
- Simplified way to pass texture via ``Tensor`` constructor.
- Improved profiling experience, now each layer will be reported separately in Unity Profiler.
- Exp, Pow and other layers are now also implemented in Compute. Improves RL model inference performance on GPU.
- Improved memory handling, now less GC allocations should be made per inference execution.
- Documentation improvements.

### Fixed
- Fixed few ComputeBuffer handling issues.
- Fixed boundary checks for Compute Copy/Concat operations.
- Fixed Broadcast layer support in ``ModelAnalyzer``.

## 0.1.3
### Added
- Added direct ``Texture`` input support. Look for ``TextureAsTensorData``. The following types of texture supported as input: ``Texture2D``, ``Texture2DArray``, ``Texture3D``, ``RenderTexture``.
- Added ``Tensor`` to ``RenderTexture`` conversion. Look for ``TensorToRenderTexture``.

### Changed
- Improved Barracuda support for Unity Profiler.
- Cleaned up Barracuda APIs.
- Autoencoder type networks can run completely on GPU now. Data roundtrip via CPU is not necessary anymore.
- Vertical flip is applied when converting between ``Texture`` and ``Tensor`` to match conventionts. To override this behavior look for ``TextureAsTensorData.Flip`` enum.

### Removed
- Removed direct reference to WebCamTexture, now Barracuda compiles for Console targets.

### Fixed
- Fixed _Conv2DTranspose_ layer support. Now GANs using _Conv2DTranspose_ work properly.

## 0.1.2
### Added
- Barracuda now is also available as preview package. Look for ``com.unity.barracuda`` in https://staging-packages.unity.com registry.
- Added profiler sample for ``Fetch()``.
- Added constructor for ``Tensor`` that allows to pass in data array.
- Added helper func ``ModelLoader.LoadFromStreamingAssets``.
- Added output trimming at run-time. See for extra parameters Worker factory.

### Changed
- Conv2D layers are now *up to 30x faster* with ``CSharpFast`` backend (``ComputeFast`` remains best backend for convolutional networks).
- TexConv2D support was temporary disabled.
- Barracuda logging now can be configured via static fields of ``Barracuda.D`` class, it allows both disable specific logging levels or just disable stack trace collection (helps with performance when profiling).
- Compute Concat implementation now will fall back to C# implementation instead of throwing exception when unsupported configuration is encountered. 
- Improved Flatten handling in TensorFlow models.
- Small docs improvements.

### Fixed
- Fixed compilation issues on Xbox One.
- Fixed several ``ComputeBuffer`` release issues.
- Fixed .meta file packaging.
- Fixed unnecessary patching of Activation layers in ``ModelLoader``.

## 0.1.1
### Added
- First internal realease as drop-in package
- Compatibility with ML Agents models: 3DBall, PushBlock, GridWorld, Soccer.

## 0.1.0
- First internal build. Due some bugs encountered wasn't published.
