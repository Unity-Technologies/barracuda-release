# Release notes

## [1.0.0] - 2020-06-01
- First verified release

## [0.8.0] - 2020-05-28
- Breaking change: API cleanup, number of internal implementation classes marked as `internal`.
- API change: `IWorker.ExecuteAsync` renamed to `IWorker.StartManualSchedule`. `IWorker.ExecuteAsync` is marked as obsolete and will issue warning if used.
- API change: `IWorker.WaitForCompletion` renamed to `IWorker.FlushSchedule`. `IWorker.WaitForCompletion` is marked as obsolete and will issue warning if used.
